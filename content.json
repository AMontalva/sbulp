Theater marquees will go dark on August 13 at 7:45PM for one minute. \"Robin Williams was a comedic genius with limitless talent and stunning versatility who left this world far too early,” said Broadway League Executive Director Charlotte St. Martin. “He made an impact on everyone he met or entertained. Whether on screen or live on stage, his multi-faceted talent always created memorable performances. Robin Williams will be greatly missed and our thoughts are with his family, friends and fans.” Williams is best known as a stand-up comedian and for his diverse roles on screen, including Good Will Hunting, for which he won an Oscar, The Fisher King, Dead Poets Society, Good Morning, Vietnam, Aladdin, Hook and Mrs. Doubtfire. He first appeared on the Great White Way in July 2002 with Robin Williams: Live on Broadway. He made his Broadway acting debut in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in 2011. His additional stage credits include Waiting for Godot opposite Steve Martin at Lincoln Center."],"image":["http://d3rm69wky8vagu.cloudfront.net/article-photos/large/1.170633.jpg"],"image/_alt":["A Broadway Salute: Theaters Will Dim Their Lights in Honor of the Late Robin Williams"],"date":["August 13, 2014 - 10:48AM"],"_resultNumber":1,"_widgetName":"broadway_buzz","_source":["8d0ff939-3f90-4305-b0ea-c79d357fb54c"],"_pageUrl":"http://www.broadway.com/buzz/177076/a-broadway-salute-theaters-will-dim-their-lights-in-honor-of-the-late-robin-williams/","_outputTypes":{"title":"STRING","date":"STRING","image":"IMAGE","body_text":"STRING"},"_input":{"webpage/url":"http://www.broadway.com/buzz/177076/a-broadway-salute-theaters-will-dim-their-lights-in-honor-of-the-late-robin-williams/"},"_num":1}]}
